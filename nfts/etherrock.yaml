    notes: |
      The original contract at had a simple mistake in the buyRock() function. The line --
      ```require(rocks[rockNumber].currentlyForSale = true);````
      Should have had a double equals.  Because of that, anyone can buy anyone else's rock 
      for the same price the owner purchased it for (regardless of whether the owner chose to sell it or not)

faq:
  - question: What are EtherRocks?
    answer: |
      Although EtherRocks, or ETHRocks, are only just gaining attention, they 
      are almost as old as the now-extremely popular CryptoPunks NFTs, selling 
      for several millions of dollars. While CryptoPunks collection was created 
      in June 2017, EtherRocks were launched in December that same year.

      ETHRocks is basically a collection of digital rocks tokenized on the Ethereum 
      blockchain. The NFT consists of still images of a “rock” which are all 
      identical in design and shape but with different color tones. The creation 
      of the EtherRocks was inspired by the Pet Rock toy craze in 1975 and only 
      100 ETHRocks will ever exist.

      Interestingly, the very first rock sold for 0.0999 ETH worth around $300 
      at that time. The other rocks were sold between 0.1 and 0.36 ETH. The 
      price increased as new rocks were minted. During the first three years of 
      its launch, only about 20 out of 100 rocks managed to sell, leaving the 
      remaining 80 rocks unclaimed.

      But the recent hype and explosive growth of NFTs have shot these virtual 
      rocks' prices beyond the moon. Currently, all of the rocks have been 
      minted and many of them have been put up for sale on the EtherRocks' NFT 
      marketplace.
