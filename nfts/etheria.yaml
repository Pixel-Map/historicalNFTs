blockchain: ethereum
creationTimestamp: Nov-01-2015 01:20:11 AM +UTC
excerpt: |
  Etheria is the first true NFT project in history, deployed October 21, 2015 
  and demoed at DEVCON 1 (Ethereum's first developer conference) on 
  November 13, 2015.
totalSupply: 457
contracts:
  - name: "Etheria v1.2 (Official)"
    address: "0xb21f8684f23dbb1008508b4de91a0aaedebdb7e4"
    notes: Etheria v1.2 is the only version supported by the original dev and on etheria.world.
  - name: "Etheria v1.1 (Deprecated)"
    address: "0xcf684dfb8304729355b58315e8019b1aa2ad1bac"
    notes: |
      Commonly referred to as Blockplots, the Etheria v1.1 contract is not sanctioned by the creator,
      and generally trades at 1/10th the value of official Etheria tiles.
  - name: "Etheria v1.0 (Legacy)"
    address: "0xe414716F017b5c1457bF98e985BCcB135DFf81F2"
    notes: |
      The very first contract launched for Etheria, has dangerous trading mechanisms, likely bugged,
      and is considered invalid.

# Red Flags
flags:
  - name: Hardcoded royalties
    level: warning
    details: |
      The original contract has royalties hardcoded directly within the contract.  Not a major issue, as once wrapped, you can trade them
      without triggering an ownership change underneath.  However, when dealing with the original contract, 40% is
      taken as part of any user-to-user transactions.
  - name: Multiple contracts
    level: warning
    details: There are currently 4 contracts that are considered to make up Etheria, v0.9, v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2.  Prior to the
      "reunification", v1.2 was considered the true Etheria, and sold at a premium.  Post-reunification, all are equal, with v0.9 and v1.0
      wrappable as ERC-721.  It is currently unknown which is considered the most valuable by collectors.
