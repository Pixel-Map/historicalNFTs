totalSupply: 457
contracts:
  - name: "Etheria v1.2 (Official)"
    address: "0xb21f8684f23dbb1008508b4de91a0aaedebdb7e4"

    address: "0xcf684dfb8304729355b58315e8019b1aa2ad1bac"
    notes: |
      Commonly referred to as Blockplots, the Etheria v1.1 contract is not sanctioned by the creator,
      and generally trades at 1/10th the value of official Etheria tiles.
  - name: "Etheria v1.0 (Legacy)"
    address: "0xe414716F017b5c1457bF98e985BCcB135DFf81F2"
    notes: |
      The very first contract launched for Etheria, has dangerous trading mechanisms, likely bugged,
      and is considered invalid.
