# Red Flags
flags:
  - name: Unlimited supply
    level: warning
    details: |
      There is no limit to the number of Deus ETH characters that can be minted
      by the contract creator wallet.  However, they do have the ability to burn
      owner address, which would then in-turn cause the supply to be static.  If
      that is completed, please let us know and we'll remove this warning.

faq:
  - question: What is Deus ETH?
    answer: |
      Deus ETH was the first web series that used NFTs and smart contracts to 
      add value to the narrative. The show was finished in 2018 and acquired a 
      small dedicated fan base.

      Nonfungible tokens representing 50 characters and 19 special characters 
      are still tradable on OpenSea. During the show, these tokens also acted 
      as utilities in the lottery.
  - question: Is Deus ETH Finished?
    answer: |
      Yes and no. In each episode of the first season, smart contracts randomly 
      determine which characters will die, as a simulation. The team was making 
      a story based on those who died and those who were alive, as an 
      interpretation. Although smart contracts have simulated all the events 
      that were planned for the season and the winners were honored, the 
      interpretation of The Final Episode is still missing. So, no one knows 
      how the last heroes survived and what happened next.
  - question: What is it all about?
    answer: |
      We are a team of creative minds whose dream was to build a new kind of 
      drama: something that combines the emotions of a trader and a TV viewer. 
      We call it the “Entertainment of Value.”

      Deus ETH is our creative approach to the blockchain community. Although 
      it was never designed for mass appeal, we are happy that Deus ETH did 
      acquire a small community.

      Here's what you need to know to understand Deus ETH:

      1. It's a drama of ownership. Owning a hero in Deus ETH means having a 
      new kind of emotional engagement with your character who can literally 
      die in any episode.

      2. It's a transmedia show that lives in many dimensions. If you explore 
      the episodes, you'll see that we tried different media formats: animation, 
      comic strip, audio, video and coubs. But, every episode also has stories 
      and obits. All of this, and every character as well, is part of the narrative.

      3. It was a creative adventure for us — we had to improvise, as we never 
      knew who would die and who would stay alive.
  - question: How to participate in Deus ETH?
    answer: |
      The show is finished, but you can trade characters on OpenSea. These 
      characters are just collectibles now and there is no utility value in them. 
      Though, if Deus ETH 2 will be released, we'll think about adding original 
      tokens to the show.
  - question: How can I support Deus ETH?
    answer: |
      To fund the development of The Final Episode, we are releasing a collection 
      of Deus ETH posters of 2069 randomly generated NFTs with original 
      characters on each of them. Part of these posters will be released for 
      free to our community.
  - question: Where can I watch Deus ETH?
    answer: |
      Deus ETH will be released on deuseth.com. Although we are using YouTube to 
      post our videos, it's recommended to watch Deus ETH on our website, as 
      there are a lot of additional exclusive materials telling the whole story.
  - question: Why is Deus ETH important?
    answer: |
      Deus ETH was the first project to combine narrative and blockchain. We 
      envisioned blockchain not only as a ledger but as a medium for art. Today, 
      a lot of projects are trying to use nonfungible tokens to fund the 
      development or to create a new layer of engagement. Deus ETH is way ahead 
      of them.
