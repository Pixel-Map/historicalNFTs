excerpt: |
  The original TerraNullius was a limitless & ownerless contract deployed on
  August 7, 2015, allowing users to write any message that they'd like directly
  to the  blockchain.  You can still call it today, as there is no limit or
  concept of ownership.

      The wrapper does NOT wrap the original contract, and is considered a
      2021 NFT inspired by the original contract.

    details: |
      TerraNullius does not contain functionality for owning or transferring assets,
      nor does it have a limit on supply.  Many people have unfortunately purchased
      from the TerraNullius V2 wrapper thinking that it contains a historic NFT, but it does
      not.  TN is only mentioned in this repository for educational purposes and as a reminder
      to always DYOR.  This can easily be proven by reviewing the original contract, or by attempting
      to unwrap from the V2 wrapper (impossible).
