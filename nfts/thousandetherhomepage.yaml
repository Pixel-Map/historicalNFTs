faq:
  - question: Can plots be subdivided or merged?
    answer: No. This is a constraint of the original contract from 2017.
      Maybe we can find some creative things to do with merged derivatives later, but assume not for now.
  - question: What is the goal of Thousand Ether Homepage?
    answer:
      The ThousandEtherHomapage is a homage to the famous MillionDollarHomepage.
      Our goal is to balance the authentic retro feel of the original project with
      a modern interpretation of Ethereum blockchain technology. What a time to be alive!
  - question: This project is not moving fast enough?
    answer: We want to make one thing very clear--When this project sold out,
      we did not pump it or even promote it. We didn't even have a Discord or
      Twitter until after it was selling out! We are grateful for the organic
      growth and we have been working hard to accelerate our original roadmap.

      At every point, we've done our best to be completely transparent about the
      state of the project and our plans for it. All of our work is open source
      and we work in public, at any moment you can go see what the progress is,
      and we've always answered questions honestly.

      We are committed to a long term vision of this project, we started in 2017
      with a 10 year time horizon in mind. It's 2021 and we're not even half done.
      We want to differentiate our project on perseverance rather than hype.

      We're delighted to have you along on this journey if it fits with your values.
