faq:
  - question: How does it work?
    answer: "https://lunartoken.co/ is a fully-functioning decentralized real estate exchange 
      built on top of Ethereum smart contracts. Originally launched in 2017, this is one of the 
      first non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ever created. For every moon plot you purchase, you receive 
      a token called a “lunar” (symbol: LUNA). Each token corresponds to a unique sector of the 
      Moon, and has a price set by the owner upon purchase. Any other visitor to the moon can 
      acquire a plot for the seller's price."
  - question: How do I send or sell my deed to someone else?
    answer: "In order to transfer or sell your moon deed, you can use lunartoken.co or interact 
      with the contract directly. Note: Sending with a traditional wallet won't work because 
      plots vary in location, size, and value—i.e. they are not fungible. Lunartoken was 
      implemented using the original EIP proposal for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning you 
      can still check your balance with a traditional ERC-20 wallet."
  - question: Is this legal?
    answer: The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 clearly states, "outer space, including the Moon and 
      other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, 
      by means of use or occupation, or by any other means." In other words, no government can 
      claim ownership of the moon. It says nothing, however, about individuals claiming ownership 
      of the moon. Accordingly, Lunar provides a decentralized service to manage everyone's 
      claims.
  - question: Where did this come from?
    answer: In the cryptocurrency community, people often use the expression, “We're going to 
      the moon!” But Lunar is the only token that will get you there.
