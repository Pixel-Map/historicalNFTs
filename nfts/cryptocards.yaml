excerpt: |
  The Cryptocards collection was created at the dawn of what is considered cryptoart or NFTs today being minted on January 2018.
  It is the only NFT collection chronicling the history of Bitcoin until Jan 2018 with 64 cards with a total supply of 8.451.

    notes: |
      The initial CryptoCards were issued as ERC-20 tokens. It was the first collection on an NFT marketplace predating OpenSea called MisfitArt. The marketplace was build by the same founders.
      The contract is a modified version of the CryptoPunks contract with marketplace features built in.

    notes: |
      This was the first ERC1155 wrapper for the collection, but unfortunately the collection is tradeable on all NFT marketplaces except OpenSea due to a contract whitelisting issue.
      We deployed a second CryptoCards ERC1155 Wrapper V2 to be compatible with OpenSea.
      An easy to use and gas efficient dApp to wrap/unwrap ERC20<-> ERC1155 Wrapper V2 is available

    notes: |
      This is the official ERC-1155 V2 Wrapper that powers the verified CryptoCards collection on OpenSea. This second iteration, addressed an OpenSea issue in the initial wrapper.

faq:
  - question: What's the big deal about Cryptocards?
    answer: It’s a historical NFT collection fully minted in Jan 2018 predating
      the launch of the ERC-721 standard. It was launched on one of the first NFT
      marketplaces on Ethereum – MisfitArt built by the same team.  A modified
      version of the CryptoPunks contract was used.  It’s the only NFT collection
      tracking Bitcoin’s history.  Each card was individually designed and not
      computer generated.
  - question: How it all started
    answer: Back in 2017, we were intrigued by the CryptoPunks collection and
      although it was deemed more of a quirky art experiment at the time.
      In July the same year, we were buzzing to start an experiment of our own.
      Although familiar with the generative NFTs we wanted to create something
      different, a collection that tells the story, about one of the the most
      powerful and disruptive technologies of our lifetime – Bitcoin.  We spent
      the better part of the year designing the collection and we finally launched
      in Jan 2018. The reception wasn’t spectacular by any metric and we moved
      on to other things.
  - question: The Rediscovery?
    answer:
      A few years later people began to better understand the paradigm-altering
      model NFT’s were bringing to the concept of ‘ownership’ itself. It was November
      2021 and after a defining booming year for the NFT space, CryptoCards was
      still undiscovered.  A few people stumbled on our website, but due to a
      glitch in our Metamask libraries which weren’t updated for a couple years,
      the estimated gas to buy a 0.005 E card was horrendous. We fixed this issue,
      built an ERC1155 wrapper and relaunched the collection.

      Before we got there, we were lucky to get in a call with AdamMcBride, a
      man who needs no introduction. He is the reason why we managed to get this
      collection in the hands and imagination of thousands of collectors.
  - question: What is the total supply?
    answer: There are 64 cards with editions from 1 to max 200 with a total
      collection supply of 8.451. There are 5 levels of ‘rarity’, with
      corresponding max supply of 200, 100, 50, 10 and 1.

      Uncommon (200 max supply)
      Rare (100)
      Very Rare (50)
      Extremely Rare (10)
      Ghost Rare (1) sold recently for 51 ETH.

      Some cards haven’t been wrapped yet. That’s why less than 200/100 etc can
      show up in the total supply on OpenSea. The cards that haven’t been wrapped
      yet still exist, they just aren’t showing up on OpenSea. Cards can be wrapped
      /unwrapped whenever the owner likes, costing a gas fee when doing so.

      Projects that were created before January 24th, 2018 had to come up with
      their own code to become non-fungible. In order to be traded on modern NFT
      marketplaces, projects need to be ERC-721 compliant. Because you can’t edit
      the code once it’s running on the blockchain, a project created before
      the nowadays NFT standard needs to be ‘wrapped’ in a smart contract that
      uses ERC-721/ERC-1155 standard.
  - question: The Where is Taiwan incident?
    answer:
      Bots swarmed into our discord posting hundreds of messages, ‘Where is Taiwan?’
      The “China Bans Bitcoin” listing on OpenSea was temporarily suspended as
      countless bots reported it as the card depicted the Chinese map without
      Taiwan in it. The bots were quickly banned from  Discord and the listing
      on OpenSea was brought back for the public to see once The CryptoCards
      community rallied and contacted OpenSea on Twitter.
  - question: The Lost Cards?
    answer:
      "When we minted the CryptoCards in Jan 2018, the market was in a frenzy with gas prices fluctuating wildly.
      Not all the CryptoCards we were minted as some transactions timed out.
      We kept track of what minting transactions went through in a database.
      During rediscovery on Nov ’21, the user interface used to buy the NFTs
      included only 61 CryptoCards. Adam got a DM from a friend who mentioned
      they just found 2 new CryptoCards mintable from the contract. We unfortunately,
      used an older database for the website found on a forgotten hardrive, that
      did not include records of 4 additional CryptoCards being minted back in Jan
      2018. The community refers to these cards as the ‘Lost Cards’.

      We did a separate sale for the Lost CryptoCards with all proceeds going
      to the treasury controlled by the DAO.

      The Lost Cards are:

      The Wright Reveal
      Bitcoin covered on The Economist
      Russia Bitcoin Regulations
      The Unknown CryptoCard. The art was lost and got burnt by the developers"
  - question: The Wrapper?
    answer: This is a historic collection and we had to built a wrapper to adapt
      it to today’s NFT standards. Simply put, ‘wrapping’ an NFT means putting
      the original NFT into a container that allows people to buy and sell on
      current marketplaces. The first wrapper built although fully functional
      on any other NFT markeplace didn’t work on OpenSea due to a whitelisting
      issue. We built a second wrapper which cleared any issues.
