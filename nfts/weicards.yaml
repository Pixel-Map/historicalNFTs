# Red Flags
flags:   
  - name: Hardcoded royalties (minor issue)
    level: warning
    details: |
      The original contract has royalties hardcoded directly within the contract.  Not a major issue, as once wrapped, you can trade them
      without triggering an ownership change underneath.  However, when unwrapping/wrapping, or dealing with the original contract, 1% is
      taken as part of any user-to-user transactions.

faq:
  - question: How does it work?
    answer: |
      WeiCards let you buy, lease and sell cards. WeiCards homepage is filled with cards ranked from 1 to 100. Each card is sold at 
      a price related to its rank, the card 1 is initially sold at 1 Ether and card 100 is set at 0.01 Ether. A card is made from a descriptive 
      title, a redirection URL and an image set by the card owner. For each card sold during the initial sale, 10% of the amount is reversed 
      to Giveth!

      If no cards are available to buy, you probably can rent one. You'll pay to the card owner a fixed amount of Ether to display your 
      details for a pre-determined duration.
  - question: So, what's the deal ?
    answer: |
      Although WeiCards looks like a regular website, it's not one, it's a Decentralized Applications (ÐApps). Cards are not loaded from our 
      database (we do not host anything) but instead directly loaded from the Ethereum blockchain. This blockchain acts like a decentralized 
      database where everyone can see its state and cannot be tampered by anyone. Once you acquired a card, it is written in the blockchain 
      and it remains forever yours.

  ## Overview by WhiteRabbit1111
  ![WeiCards](https://pixelmap.art/nfts/images/weicards-misc.png "WeiCards")

  WeiCards was an early blockchain project that allows users to buy, lease and sell promotional cards on the site. The WeiCards homepage is 
  filled with cards ranked from 1 to 100. Each card is made from a descriptive title, a redirection URL and an image set by the card owner.
  
  Owners have the option to rent their WeiCard out to someone for a fixed price and duration, sell it to a fixed price and edit their card details

  WeiCards are a particularly unusual asset, and I suspect that they will remain a highly sought after historical relic in perpetuity.
  
  There are a small handful of buggy WeiCard contracts on the site, so if the buy price seems too good to be true — it probably is. Given 
  the age of the site, you will need to manually connect your MetaMask wallet (a setting available on Metamask) and if the gas fee seems 
  extraordinarily high then do not proceed as you are most likely interacting with on of the defunct contracts.

  ## The History of WeiCards and ETHMap by MagicDrops

  It all started on December 19 of 2017 when Willdn pushed the WeiCards code to a new GitHub repository. Little did Willdn know, he was 
  creating a historic project that would be unearthed and resurrected nearly 4 years later.

  The official production build for WeiCards was released on December 30, 2017. With one day to spare, WeiCards was officially launched 
  and solidified in the category of 2017 NFT projects that are currently being rediscovered by collectors. The reason 2017 is such an 
  important year for NFTs is it is the same year that CryptoPunks were released. Very few projects existed in the NFT space before 2017
   and many were just experiments and fun side projects for developers to toy with coding in solidity. Every year since 2017 we have seen 
   exponential growth in the amount of projects released as NFTs, so it makes any project before 2018 true relics in most collectors eyes.

  WeiCards is extremely simple in its structure and how it works. There are 100 WeiCards available. Each one represents a digital billboard
   or advertising space on the website. It allows users to purchase a WeiCard and upload their own image, title, and link to where the 
   WeiCard would direct a user when that WeiCard is clicked. It also allows the owner of a card to lease or rent out their WeiCard to others 
   at any price and duration the owner chooses. A simple yet innovative idea that could provide passive income to the owner of a WeiCard who 
   wants to allow their WeiCard to be rented out for a temporary amount of time.

  Only 6 WeiCards were originally purchased within the first few weeks of the project launching. Then the project lay dormant for 1316 days 
  with no activity on the contract. On August 16, 2021 that all would change.

  This is where ETHMap enters the picture. ETHMap was published to GitHub and deployed on February 2, 2018. It saw a lot more activity 
  (buys and sells) during its initial days, however, it soon became inactive with the last contract activity recorded on August 19th, 2018. 
  For the next 1,093 days, the contract remained with no activity besides one user and transaction withdrawing funds from a previous sale 
  years before, but no buys or sells. 

  ETHMap was discovered by collectors before WeiCards. ETHMap was another simple project by Willdn that allowed a user to connect their 
  MetaMask wallet and purchase a country on a digital map. A user could visit the site purchase the USA, India, Japan, etc. There were a 
  total of 178 countries that could be claimed by users. 

  On August 16th, 2021 the ETHMap project was rediscovered by the archeologists of the modern NFT space. It was quickly shared around 
  different Discords and Twitter DMs. Within just a few hours, every country had an owner and Willdn had earned over 50eth nearly 4 years 
  after he initially released the project. 

  Previous owners who listed their ETHMap country up for sale years ago came to find that their countries were purchased during the 
  onslaught of the discovery. Very shortly after ETHMap exploded, owners noticed that Willdn had another project on GitHub that pre-dated 
  ETHMap. That project was WeiCards. WeiCards proceeded to quickly sell out all remaining 94 cards.

  August 16th of 2021 will forever go down in the history books for these two projects. A community was built on Discord and users began 
  pouring in to connect with one another and share their latest purchases. The community soon banded together to try and find Willdn and 
  share with him that his projects had now exploded and had a much bigger audience of collectors.

  From what we can discern from the community attempting to contact Willdn in every way imaginable, he wanted to remain out of the 
  spotlight. The ETH was withdrawn from both contracts and WIlldn never joined the newly formed Discord created by his new and enthusiastic 
  community.

  Willdn had obviously gotten the message that his projects were now highly sought after historical NFT relics, but he has chosen to 
  remain anonymous to the community at large.

  The community decided that it was best to move the project forward without Willdn’s involvement. He wanted to maintain anonymity 
  and the community wished to respect his right to privacy. 

  Things move quickly in the NFT space and the WeiCards and ETHMap community was no exception.Within 2 days (by August 18th, 2021) a wrapper 
  had made by community members so that each ETHMap country could officially be an ERC-721 token and listed on OpenSea to make them visible 
  to a larger market of NFT buyers and sellers. A new website (https://ethmap.app/) followed shortly after that which allowed users to 
  purchase countries and wrap their countries. Purchasing directly on the original site had many bugs and problems which the community 
  quickly patched.

  Within just another few days, a new website for WeiCards (https://wei.cards/) which kept the same interface but fixed major bugs preventing 
  users from connecting their MetaMask wallet to buy, sell, and lease directly on the site.

  These two projects prove a few things. Early projects like CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, MoonCats, WeiCards, ETHMap, etc all have an 
  nherent value simply from their historical significance. It also proves the old adage of “it takes a village to raise a child.” These 
  projects were discovered, the sites for both did not work, and the community came together to push the project forward and make it more 
  accessible to the larger NFT market. It is truly incredible to witness the power a dedicated community can have. In days the floor price 
  for WeiCards went from 1ETH to 10ETH+. It is clear that the only place to go for these early projects that get rediscovered is up.
