# Primary Info
title: Pride Punks
blockchain: ethereum
creationTimestamp: Jun-23-2018 03:23:34 AM +UTC
excerpt: |
  PridePunks were launched Jun 23, 2018 as a celebration of CryptoPunks, Pride month and a statement on the lack of inclusivity of Web3.
  They were created at a time when LarvaLabs Punks traded for dollars and were intended to be a collaborative project to make Punks more exciting.
totalSupply: 10000
contracts:
  - name: MetaPunk Token (Pride Punks Contract)
    address: "0x0144b7e66993c6bfab85581e8601f96bfe50c9df"
    notes: Originally required wrapping a valid LarvaLabs punk, later modified via a second contract.
  - name: MetaPunkController
    address: "0x0144b7e66993c6bfab85581e8601f96bfe50c9df"
    notes: In the 2022 system the MetaPunkController is the owner of the MetaPunk Token 2018 . This means the controller controls all the 
      functionality of the token and enforces the 10k limit as well as assigns metadata for each token as it is minted.

# Red Flags
flags:
  - name: Centralization
    level: alert
    details: |
      Currently, the supply limit & ability to mint is centralized, and controlled by the MetaPunkController contract.  Per the FAQ, 
      once it is known that the MetaPunkController is functioning properly, the PridePunk DAO will be given ownership over the MetaPunk 
      Controller and the MetaPunkToken, the DAO members then can vote to end the mint (if the mint it still going on) or to burn the 
      ownership keys completely.  If the ownership keys are burned, staticSupply will be considered to be true for this NFT, and this alert
      will be removed.

faq:
  - question: When is the mint? How much? What about the rainbowlist? etc...
    answer: TBD
  - question: Are NFTs minted in 2018 and 2022 on different contracts?
    answer: No, all NFTs are minted on the original 2018 contract. 
  - question: Are these NFTs original 2018 NFTs?
    answer: The original mint was never finished. Only two tokens were minted in 2018. With the mint reopening, these are 2022 NFT's 
      minted on the original 2018 contract. 
  - question: If PridePunks are from 2018, can I un-wrap the 2022 smart contract?
    answer: No, PridePunks are not wrapped. All PridePunks minted are NFTs on the original 2018 NFT contract.
  - question: How many NFT's were minted in 2018?
    answer: Two NFTs were minted in 2018. ~150 Tokens were minted in March 2022 as part of rediscovery and testing.
  - question: Does the wrapper hold the new token? How does this work?
    answer: The MetaPunk Controller contract is the Owner of the original 2018 contract. It controls it completely. At the end of the mint 
      ownership will be transferred to the PridePunkDao contract. Voters can decide to burn the ownership key, if they want, locking the 
      2018 contract forever. 
  - question: Is the mint function on the 2018 contract unlimited?
    answer: No. The 2018 contract is designed to be used with a Controller contract. The controller contract limits the possible number of 
      minted NFTs to 10,000.  (Editor note -- the 2018 contract is technically unlimited.  If/once the key to the controller contract
      is burned, then it will truly be limited to 10k mints)
  - question: Is there a 'wrapper' contract? And does it hold the NFTs?
    answer: No. PridePunks are not wrapped Tokens. The NFTs are all minted on the 2018 contract, which is what the user receives. There is a 
      'controller' contract that owns the original 2018 contract to manage minting.
  - question: But I heard talk about a wrapper? What does this mean?
    answer: Originally in the design of the 2018 system (which was not very good), it was required that you 'wrap' a real CryptoPunk before 
      you could mint a PridePunk. This functionality was a bad idea and is no longer used. Only two NFTs ever wrapped a real CryptoPunk. 
      The new 2022 Controller impersonates the original CryptoPunk contract and allows to mint PridePunks without wrapping a CryptoPunk.
  - question: Did you say PridePunkDao?
    answer: Yes. There will be more information about this soon, but the PridePunkDAO will be an on-chain DAO that manages the PridePunk 
      Ecosystem treasury. More info post-mint!
  - question: How much control will the creator maintain over the contracts?
    answer: At the end of the mint all contract admin roles will be transferred to the DAO. The only reason for keeping them during the 
      mint it to be able to help in an emergency
