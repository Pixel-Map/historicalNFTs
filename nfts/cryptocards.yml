  The Cryptocards collection was created at the dawn of what is considered cryptoart or NFTs today being minted on January 2018.
  It is the only NFT collection chronicling the history of Bitcoin until Jan 2018 with 64 cards with a total supply of 8.451.

    notes: |
      The initial CryptoCards were issued as ERC-20 tokens. It was the first collection on an NFT marketplace predating OpenSea called MisfitArt. The marketplace was build by the same founders.
      The contract is a modified version of the CryptoPunks contract with marketplace features built in.
  - name: CryptoCards Wrapper V1,
    address: "0x86a68f655018389658f657257fd6d0c337c09351"
    notes: |
      This was the first ERC1155 wrapper for the collection, but unfortunately the collection is tradeable on all NFT marketplaces except OpenSea due to a contract whitelisting issue.
      We deployed a second CryptoCards ERC1155 Wrapper V2 to be compatible with OpenSea.
      An easy to use and gas efficient dApp to wrap/unwrap ERC20<-> ERC1155 Wrapper V2 is available

    notes: |
      This is the official ERC-1155 V2 Wrapper that powers the verified CryptoCards collection on OpenSea. This second iteration, addressed an OpenSea issue in the initial wrapper.
