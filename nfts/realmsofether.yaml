# FAQ
faq:
  - question: Who is the original dev?
    answer: The OG dev has never been identified.
  - question: How do I wrap or unwrap my Fortress into an ERC-721?
    answer: Use the wrapper built by 0xngmi here - https://0xngmi.github.io/fortresses/frontend/index.html
      1 >> "Get fortress hashes"
      2 >> "Claim"
      3 >> "Transfer"
      4 >> "Wrap"
  - question: On the https://realms-of-ether.github.io/ website the minting shows 500/1000. Can we still mint Fortresses?
    answer: The original developer listed 1000 total Fortresses on the website. However, when deploying the contract they capped the minting at 500 total. This is why the website shows 500/1000 Fortresses minted.
  - question: Why do the Fortresses on Opensea show minting happened in August 2021?
    answer: Realms of Ether was developed in 2017, prior to the NFT ERC-721 standard that is used for NFTs today and which all NFTs trading 
      on Opensea use. In August 2021 0xngmi developed an ERC-721 wrapper so that Fortresses minted on the website could be traded on Opensea. 
      The Opensea mint date represents the date that the Fortress was wrapped into the ERC-721 format.
  - question: How were the Fortresses being traded before the ERC-721 wrapper?
    answer: Realms of Ether has a high level of functionality for a 2017 blockchain game. The auction house in the game is fully functional and was being utilised by the community to buy and sell Fortresses.
  - question: Can we still use the in-game auction house?
    answer: Fortresses can be easily wrapped and unwrapped. Owners can trade their unwrapped Fortress on the in-game auction house, or they can wrap their Fortress and trade it on Opensea.
  - question: Is the original developer still involved in the game?
    answer: Unfortunately attempts to contact the original developer have not been successful. The project is currently being run by the 
      community through this Discord. If you're the original developer and reading this, please let us know! We would love for you to be involved! 
  - question: What does the website do?
    answer: https://realmsofether.com/ is the community built dashboard. The “Inspector” feature shows the traits of each fortress, when it 
      was minted, and a rarity score. The “Gold Mine” feature allows fortress owners to stake their RoE NFT for GOLD, an ERC-20 that will be 
      used in future DAO initiatives. The “Learn” feature shares more about the journey of Realms of Ether. The GOLD contract is located 
      at https://etherscan.io/token/0x4F9dEcDF87428AED7C1dAdE33B5f31f58BA0e3DA. 
  - question: There’s a DAO?
    answer: "All fortress owners are automatically in the DAO. The DAO supports the community and its mission. 
      Draft proposals for the DAO are made in #dao-proposals and final votes are held at https://snapshot.org/#/realmsofether.eth. 
      The DAO treasury is located at https://etherscan.io/address/0xda6967678522c04d2d0c362808220d69dbe2ca31. 

      The treasury has a 5 member multi-sig, and transactions are executed after 3 members have signed."
  - question: What is citadel.art?
    answer: https://www.citadel.art/ is a community led initiative by an anonymous developer. From what we know so far, it is an NFT gallery 
      within a Realms of Ether castle. Only fortress owners have access to the NFT gallery. The project is under continuous development with no timeline. 
  - question: What’s the castle purchase proposal?
    answer: The DAO voted to purchase a real world Medieval European castle for shared ownership by DAO members. The proposal is a long term 
      project and discussion for specifics are ongoing. The snapshot for the original proposal is located at 
      https://snapshot.org/#/realmsofether.eth/proposal/0xb45190c6db7bd1e7462f0e22d93cd08666edee6093ed495bc5c208fa97e25e39. 

      The draft idea paper is located for the specifics of the proposal is located at 
      https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-LW-g2mz6J-lsLjC4C_QlKZ-GCfaBZP3sDZHetst1o/edit. The proposal is a living document that is 
      continuously updated based on community discussions. 
  - question: The treasury owns Realms of Ether castles?
    answer: The DAO passed a proposal to authorize the treasury to purchase floor-price castles. Since then, the DAO has acquired 3 Realms of Ether castles. There are no plans to sell them at the moment. 
      The original proposal is located at https://snapshot.org/#/realmsofether.eth/proposal/QmQXpg6Qhj8jQcju66ZUacVGHcKt466EiiwFoCNZa3ceL8
