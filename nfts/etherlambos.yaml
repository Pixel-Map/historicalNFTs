      Currently, the supply limit, ability to mint, and abilty to transfer is centralized.  The EtherLambos contract
      includes three roles, a CEO, CFO, and COO.  The CEO can pause transfers/sales at any time, and the COO can mint
      an unlimited number of new models.  All 3 roles are currently still controlled by private wallets.

faq:
  - question: What is Etherlambos?
    answer:
      Etherlambos are non-fungible ERC721 tokens. As one of the world's first
      cryptocollectibles, users can own, collect, and transfer those tokens on the blockchain. But that’s not all.
      We have utilized smart contracts to enable owners of Etherlambos to modify and update all digital sports cars.
  - question: How many Etherlambo-models are available?
    answer:
      There are currently six Etherlambo-models available. Etherlambos cannot be copied or destroyed. All
      Etherlambos come in a limited edition. Scarcity of each model is a production and design choice.
  - question: All Etherlambos are unique and amazing. However, I always dreamed of creating my very own digital car. Is this possible?
    answer:
      Yes, upon request, we will tailor individual vehicles to suit the desire of car enthusiasts. The model “X”
      (you may choose the name) will be designed based on the specifications and wishes of clients, who will benefit
      from premium tuning-options.
  - question: Do Etherlambos have a value?
    answer:
      It is clear that the prices of blockchain assets are volatile and that the value of Etherlambos depends
      on market demand, as well as the functioning of the app on the Ethereum blockchain, which we cannot guarantee.
      Other risks include regulatory interventions, changes of the Ethereum blockchain infrastructure or other reasons
      related to the legal or technical environment. We do not guarantee any value or utility of the Etherlambo tokens.

  ## Additional Information
  The collection consists of 1600 total lambos, all named after different 
  blockchains/founders.

  ![Etherlambos Rarity](https://pixelmap.art/nfts/images/etherlambos-rarity.png "EtherLambos")

  The original mint lambos from 2018 are known to the community as the "OG" lambos are serial numbers #1-100 for all 
  models except T-Rex which is #50 and under.

  **When you look at the mint dates on OpenSea it doesn't render for the correct date unless you click on the link to 
  the contract and look at the transactions where you will see the OG dates so the supply and serial numbers are a 
  good rule of thumb to go buy when evaluating rarity. **

  ## Economics of Collectibles: Meet Etherlambos www.etherlambos.io

  Etherlambos is the 1st dealer of digital high-end luxury vehicles on the Ethereum blockchain. At the verge of the next blockchain revolution, we produce collectible sports cars, issued as non-fungible Ethereum tokens. Etherlambos also answers the pertinent question “when lambo?”, a meme which inspired the entire cryptocurrency-community and our team to think outside the box. Committed to excellence, Etherlambos will build-up an impeccable reputation as THE to-go blockchain vehicle seller. We will also accommodate the needs of tuning enthusiasts and creative minds by enabling modifications and updates of all vehicles.

  ## Models and Scarcity: BUY - TRADE - TUNE

  We are honored to offer seven unique Etherlambos, which are 100 % owned by the customers and cannot be copied or destroyed. Etherlambos will be a valuable collectible commodity, allowing clients to >buy, >sell and >tune the digital cars.


  All models come in a limited edition, which makes them even more valuable: scarcity is a production and design choice.

  - Model "Vitalik" — new dimensions: Vitalik is a masterpiece of art and technique. Total supply: 250
  - Model "Dasher" - a dream comes true: Our Dasher is both incredibly beautiful and almost impossible to catch. Total supply: 300
  - Model "Repel" - the absolute opposite of an ordinary sports car: Future-proof design meets on and off-road capabilities. Total supply: 350
  - Model "Monera" - the dark knight. Innovative, sportive, versatile, untraceable. Our community favorite. Total supply: 400
  - Model "One" - a Chinese icon for craftsmanship. Representing luxury and heritage. Total supply: 450
  - Model "Mad Doge" - the unconventional hunter. Mad doge is a synonym for instinct and extravagance. Total supply: 500

  Upon request, Etherlambos will tailor an individual vehicle to suit the desires of car enthusiasts: the Model “X” will be designed based on the specification and wishes of clients, who will also benefit from premium tuning options.  Whether Etherlambos will create and produce new models in the future depends on the market demand.

  ## Modification/Tuning

  Every vehicle can be tuned, which will translate into a change of design, engine capacity, or driving behavior. All models can be modified within the range of the performance kits

  **interior,
  exterior, and
  engine.**

  For example, the performance kit exterior of “Vitalik” allows owners to add an impressive spoiler roof, clever air scoops, or a noticeable wheel spider disk. When it comes to engine tuning, the exhaust system can be modified or turbo-charger added.

  ## Technical Details: Unique. Interchangeable. Rare.

  We emulate our rare and collectible digital cars with Ethereum tokens, which are build on the novel ERC721 Ethereum standard. Our smart contract guarantees both trade-ability and non-fungibility.

  ## Timeline and Shipping: February 2018

  All Etherlambos will be officially presented at a kick-off event in February 2018. The presentation will mark the begin of a limited promoted sales period of three weeks during which Etherlambos can be purchased for a reduced price (while stock lasts). Already before the kick-off, there will be reservation options for clients who wish to secure their right of purchase in advance.
