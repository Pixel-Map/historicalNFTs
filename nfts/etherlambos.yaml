      Currently, the supply limit, ability to mint, and abilty to transfer is centralized.  The EtherLambos contract
      includes three roles, a CEO, CFO, and COO.  The CEO can pause transfers/sales at any time, and the COO can mint
      an unlimited number of new models.  All 3 roles are currently still controlled by private wallets.

  ## Additional Information
  The collection consists of 1600 total lambos, all named after different 
  blockchains/founders.

  ![Etherlambos Rarity](https://pixelmap.art/nfts/images/etherlambos-rarity.png "EtherLambos")

  - 100 MODEL SATOSHI
  - 150 MODEL T-REX
  - 200 MODEL CHARLIE
  - 200 COINSHARES x EL
  - 250 MODEL VITALIK
  - 300 MODEL ONE
  - 400 MODEL MONERA

  1600 TOTAL LAMBOS

  The original mint lambos from 2018 are known to the community as the "OG" lambos are serial numbers #1-100 for all 
  models except T-Rex which is #50 and under.

  **When you look at the mint dates on OpenSea it doesn't render for the correct date unless you click on the link to 
  the contract and look at the transactions where you will see the OG dates so the supply and serial numbers are a 
  good rule of thumb to go buy when evaluating rarity. **
