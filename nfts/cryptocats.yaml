excerpt: |
  CryptoCats are one of the scarcest NFT collections from that time with only 
  625 tokens. Predating the ERC721, there are some pretty cute function names in the smart contract.
  Each CryptoCat is unique and most are programmatically generated with different accessories.

  - name: Buggy Contract 1
    address: "0x9508008227b6b3391959334604677d60169EF540"
    notes: |
      Soon after this contract was deployed we realised it had a buggy withdraw 
      function. Whoever bought tokens from this contract wasted that ETH, this is sad.
  - name: Buggy Contract 2
    address: "0x19c320b43744254ebdBcb1F1BD0e2a3dc08E01dc"
    notes: |
      This was deployed on Christmas Eve, once we realised the bug in Buggy 
      Contract 1. This contract was deployed but we immediately realised it had 
      a new bug, pointing to testnet, making it unusable to migrate tokens 
      from release 1 & 2. It couldn't be used to fork and migrate the previous 
      tokens into it.
