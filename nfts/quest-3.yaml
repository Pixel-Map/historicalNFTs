faq:
  - question: What is Quest-3?
    answer: Quest-3 is a mid-90s riff on an NFT.  It's an April Fool's joke, but
      it's also a real, fully functional, legitimate, CC0, 100% on-chain, usable NFT.
  - question: Can I get on the whitelist?
    answer: You've had 28 years to mint. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  - question: What is the mint price?
    answer: The mint price is 0.01994206980085, but each action in your quest is free - just pay shipping and handling (priced in gwei)
  - question: What happened to the mail-in option?
    answer: Since blockchain technology has come so far, we've decided to discontinue the mail-in mint option. We appreciate your continued support over the decades, and we apologize for any inconvenience. If you feel you've been rugged, go fax yourself.
  - question: CAN QUEST-3 TOKENS BE TRADED?
    answer: You bet!
  - question: HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO FINISH MY QUEST-3?
    answer: Everyone's journey happens at their own pace, you good.
  - question: Where's the roadmap?
    answer: Where we're going, we don't need roadmaps.
  - question: IS THERE STAKING?
    answer: See above
  - question: WILL THERE BE A TOKEN?  WHAT'S THE TOKENOMICS?
    answer: See roadmap
  - question: A DEVELOPER JUST IM'ED ME AND SAID I NEED TO FAX MY SEED PHRASE TO THEM???
    answer: No one from Pondertech Digital Solutions will ever ask for your seed phrase. Never fax, AIM, or otherwise share with anyone your seed phrase.
  - question: Why didn't you use an L2?
    answer: L2 isn't Y2K compatible.
  - question: I took an action but nothing happened. What's the deal?
    answer: Making it takes time. "Doing something" doesn't mean you will get an
      outcome immediately. Your fate depends upon the actions of other
      travelers. This not only guarantees randomness and prevents
      people from cheating, but it unites everyone in their quest to make
      it. Be patient. If too few travelers "do something", you may have the
      opportunity to take a heroic action! Stay vigilant.
  - question: Wait, so I really have to pay gas to continue my quest?
    answer: Yes.
  - question: How long do I have to finish my journey?
    answer: It's ok buddy, everyone journeys at their own pace.
  - question: One of your developers just IM'd me asking me to fax them my seed phrase. Is this legit?
    answer: No one from Pondertech Digital Solutions will ever ask for your seed phrase. Never fax, AIM, or give anyone your seed phrase.
  - question: How can I see my journey later?
    answer: The entirety of your journey is stored on-chain. You can view it here or in various marketplaces. Or if you're L337, query the contract's tokenURI function directly.
  - question: How did Pondertech develop an NFT in 1994?
    answer: Quest-3 is the ponderware April Fool’s joke for 2022 – however, this
      is also a 100% on-chain, CC0, fully functional NFT you can mint, play
      with, trade, and more! We hope it transports you to
      the early days of the internet.
