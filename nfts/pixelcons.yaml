      All data for each tile is stored directly on the OG contract.  The
      image data for each tile is stored as hex triplets (768 char total), with
      Base91 encoding + PAKO compression to minimize gas fees.

    notes: |
      New Invaders can be uncovered (minted) by anyone who owns PixelCons. 
      Invaders are generated using existing PixelCons as a source of randomness 
      and minted as PixelCons themselves.

      There is no limit to the number of PixelCons that can be created as long 
      as it is unique.  However, historic PixelCons can be found from as far 
      back as 2018 and the special Genesis series minted at contract launch 
      can be found by filtering by "2018 Genesis" on OpenSea.
