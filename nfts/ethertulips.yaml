# Red Flags
flags:
  - name: Centralization
    level: alert
    details: |
      The EtherTulips bridge is controlled by the creator address.  If that account went rogue or was compromised, the 
      bridge contract has a vulnerability in that the creator could unwrap all wrapped tokens back to itself via changing
      the V2 contract address.  A similar vulnerability going the other direction also likely exists, as the bridge itself
      holds the V1 tokens, not the wrapper contract.
  - name: Unlimited supply
    level: warning
    details: |
      There is no limit to the number of EtherTulips that can be created.  However,
      the number of Gen0 and Gen1 EtherTulips has a soft cap built-in, due to a hardcoded
      increase of price for new mints.  Currently, to mint a new Gen0 would cost 100E, so
      the supply is semi limited for older generations.  Newer generations can be created
      with no fee and unlimited minting, and are therefore unlikely to have value.

faq:
  - question: What are all those tulips that look the same on OpenSea selling for ~0.01eth?
    answer: |
      EtherTulips does not endorse and is not affiliated with OpenSea. In February 
      2018, we released as a valentine's day easter egg a sister collection EtherValentines. 
      As part of this collection, there were three types of roses. Since we didn't intend these roses to be 
      collectibles, they were set as infinitely mintable at a price of 0.01eth.  As a result, to this day 
      EtherValentines roses can still be minted directly from the contract for 0.01eth (+gas).

      Back then (in 2018), fixed cap total supply wasn't a major feature of NFT collections. 
      So, since we wanted to easily be able to show/send EtherValentines roses within the same 
      collection as EtherTulips, we added them as extra generations in the same contract. 
      They were never for sale officially through ethertulips.com as Generations 2, 3, or 4, only 
      through the EtherValentines site as roses (Gen 2/3/4 is only an internal identifier in the 
      contract code to make things work together).
  - question: Why don't roses have any attributes and why do they all look the same on OpenSea?
    answer:
      EtherValentines roses display correctly with attributes on EtherTulips.com. As a reminder, OpenSea is a
      third party that EtherTulips does not support or endorse. However, to give some history, when OpenSea listed
      EtherTulips they wrote custom code to scrape EtherTulips images. For some reason, it seems that that custom
      scraper does not work with Gens 2/3/4, and OpenSea instead displays the project icon (which is why they all
      look identical on OpenSea). We've submitted a ticket with OpenSea to notify them of the issue, but we have
      no control over their code.
  - question: Why is EtherTulips upgrading to a new contract?
    answer: |
      EtherTulips was first released in January 2018. Back then, the ERC-721 standard was still an unfinalized draft 
      (that's how old we are!), and so certain protocols that rely on the modern finalized ERC-721 standard may not 
      fully support EtherTulips (for example, OpenSea's EtherTulips image scraper). Additionally, as mentioned 
      previously, fixed cap total supply wasn't a major feature of NFT collections back then.

      Fast forward to 2021, and now ERC-721 is a finalized standard and fixed cap total supply is a standard feature 
      of collectable NFTs. So, we want to update the EtherTulips contract to make EtherTulips fully compatible with 
      ERC-721 compliant NFT protocols (such as OpenSea), and it makes sense that the scarcity of Gen 0/1 tulips 
      shouldn't be tarnished by the infinitely mintable 0.01eth EtherValentines roses. Therefore, only Gen 0/1 tulips 
      will be able to be bridged to the upgraded contract, and the total supply between Gen 0/1/2021 on the upgraded 
      contract will be capped at 12,345.
  - question: How will the upgraded contract affect the history and lineage of Gen 0/1 tulips?
    answer: |
      We took history and lineage heavily into account in the design of the contract upgrade. First, Gen 0/1 tulips on 
      the new contract will include attributes indicating their mint date.

      Additionally, the bridge from the legacy contract to the new contract will be bidirectional: Gen 0/1 tulips can 
      be moved back and forth between the legacy and upgraded contracts at any time. 

      Effectively, the upgraded contract is like a wrapper around the legacy contract. As an empirical example, the 
      original CryptoPunks contract also isn't ERC-721 compliant; to make CryptoPunks interoperable with NFT dapps like 
      OpenSea an ERC-721 wrapper was created. It doesn't look like the wrapper has had any negative effect on CryptoPunks' 
      collectability!
  - question: What will happen to EtherValentines rose?
    answer: |
      Absolutely nothing! Although EtherValentines roses will not be able to be bridged to the upgraded contract, the 
      legacy contract will continue to stick around for the duration of the lifespan of the Ethereum blockchain. 
      You'll be able to continue to view, manage, and battle your EtherValentines roses at https://legacy.ethertulips.com/.
  - question: How do I mint new tulips?
    answer: |
      Generation 2021, the final generation of EtherTulips with a fixed cap of 5,094 tulips, has dropped at 
      https://ethertulips.com/shop. Although more Gen 0/1 tulips can technically be minted on the legacy contract 
      (at high cost--100eth for Gen 0 and ~2.6eth for Gen 1), new Gen 0/1 tulips will not be able to be bridged to 
      the upgraded contract.

  ## Tulip mania. Now with fights. On the blockchain.

  Tulip mania was a bubble in the 17th century during which prices for tulips rose to ridiculous levels. One bulb 
  cost more than a house! The tulip market crashed in 1637, so you were born too late to participate â€” but no worries!

  We're bringing tulip mania to the 21st century. Each adorable EtherTulip lives on the Ethereum blockchain, where 
  they can be securely bought, traded, and battled. All EtherTulips have unique DNA, which determines their appearance 
  and battle traits. Want a particularly powerful tulip? Buy some seeds, or trade with someone else. But hurry: prices 
  are rising exponentially by the day. You don't want to miss out, do you?
