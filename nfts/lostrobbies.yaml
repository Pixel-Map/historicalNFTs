excerpt: |
  On July 17, 2018, Christies held their first ever annual Tech Summit in London. SuperRare had just launched a few months prior and the team was stoked to have the chance to attend and network with titans of the traditional art industry. At the time, the digital art world as we know it was still emerging and largely unknown, especially digital art tokenized on the blockchain. 

  SuperRare was invited to add to the gift bags of the 300+ attendees, and wanting to do something cool and unique decided to partner with Jason Bailey and enlist Robbie Barrat, the first artist to ever tokenize on SuperRare, to create an artwork with 300 individual frames that could each be tokenized and given away to the attendees.

  Robbie created AI Generated Nude Portrait #7 for the event, which he intended as 300 separate frames of a single artwork. Each of the 300 frames was tokenized separately and added to redeemable ETH gift cards with directions for how to claim the 1/1 token on SuperRare.
