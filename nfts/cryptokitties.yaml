      Currently, the supply limit, ability to mint, and abilty to transfer is centralized.  The CryptoKitties contract
      includes three roles, a CEO, CFO, and COO.  The CEO can pause transfers/sales at any time, and anyone can mint new kitties.  All 3

faq:
  - question: Why are CryptoKitties listed as on-chain on NFTArchaeology.io?
    answer: |
      While the art is NOT onchain, the parts that matter as part of the game (with a focus on breeding), are all stored directly on-chain.
      Even the "genes" of the cat are stored directly within the contract.
  - question: How do CryptoKitties work?
    answer: |
      CryptoKitties are non-fungible tokens, originally built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC721 token standard. Before the 
      existence of ERC721, tokens on blockchains were fungible, or interchangeable--any one Bitcoin or Ethereum token is identical to any 
      other. ERC721 allowed for the creation of unique, non-fungible tokens.
  - question: How do I breed CryptoKitties?
    answer: |
      To breed your own CryptoKitty, all you need is a breeding pair; either one can act as the Sire or Dame. The Sire will need a short 
      recovery period after breeding, which increases each time they sire. The Dame will be unable to breed while incubating your new kitten.

      To breed two Kitties you own together, click on one of them in your litter, and then click the "Breed" button that pops up; this will 
      be the Sire. Then click on "Sire with my Kitties," and pick a cat to act as Dame; hit "OK, give them some privacy" to open up a 
      transaction window, and soon you'll have your very own bouncing baby CryptoKitty.

      Alternatively, you can breed one of your cats with a public sire, which will incur a small transaction fee.
  - question: How many Gen-0 cats are there?
    answer: 34928 (Gen-0 Kitty production stopped in November 2018), ongoing creation of other gen series

  ## Overview by WhiteRabbit1111
  ![CryptoKitties](https://api.nftarchaeology.io/images/cryptokitties-misc.png "CryptoKitties")
  This is another project that needs little introduction. Cryptokitties was one of the earliest blockchain games on Ethereum and was 
  developed by Canadian studio Dapper Labs. The game allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell virtual cats, and is credited with 
  helping define the ERC721 early NFT standard.


  CryptoKitties was a truly history-making game which caught the imagination of the crypto community in relation to the potential of digital 
  collectables on the blockchain. The project also gained a great deal of attention due to the high level of in-game activity that served to 
  bring Ethereum to its knees in terms of speeds, congestion and high fees. The very high prices that users were paying to buy and breed 
  kitties was also making headlines at the time.

  The game still operates and new kitties continue to be bred. It is the endless supply of new kitties that may have contributed to a 
  reduction of interest and value amongst collectors. However, there remain many kitties with rare attributes along with the Founder 
  kitties that have retained significant value.
