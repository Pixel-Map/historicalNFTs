# Red Flags
flags:   
  - name: Hardcoded royalties
    level: warning
    details: |
      The original contract has royalties hardcoded directly within the contract.  Not a major issue, as once wrapped, you can trade them
      without triggering an ownership change underneath.  However, when unwrapping/wrapping, or dealing with the original contract, 1% is
      taken as part of any user-to-user transactions.
