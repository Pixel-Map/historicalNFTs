# Red Flags
flags:
  - name: Multiple versions
    level: warning
    details: The \"Official CryptoPunks\ are considered V2.  A previous contract exists that was disavowed by the creators (LarvaLabs).  It
      is important to note that the previous contract IS still actively wrapped and traded, but at a significant discount due to the risks
      of a cease and desist on the collection or other legal actions.  YugaLabs acquired LarvaLabs, and has appeared to not take an interest
      in pursuing V1 at the current time.
  - name: Security vulnerability
    level: alert
    details: The V1 CryptoPunks contract contains a vulnerability that allows someone to steal your punk via frontrunning when listing it
      for sale.  This can be prevented once wrapped, but is important to keep in mind for V1 collectors.
