# Red Flags
flags: 
  - name: Hardcoded royalties
    level: alert
    details: Royalty fees are directly controlled via the contract, and adjustable at any time by the creators.  While most projects have
      royalties on various marketplaces, having it directly controlled by the contract means that a compromised key or bad actor could
      set it to 100% and there would be no possibility of setting up a new collection or listing on a different marketplace as a workaround.
  - name: Unverified contract
    level: warning
    details: It's difficult to identify vulnerabilities or the supply, as the original contract cannot be verified.
  - name: Cannot unwrap
    level: warning
    details: Wrapping an original CryptoCities token is a one-way process, wrapped cities cannot be unwrapped.

faq:
  - question: Introduction for Newbies?
    answer: CryptoCities was launched in Feb 2018 after being actively developed through 2017. It's one of the earliest NFT projects around
      and has largely flown under the radar for most of it's time. Most development of the game took place in 2018 and since then it has been 
      running but not actively developed during the crypto winter of 2019/2020. The game has been maintained through the years with small 
      fixes, tweaks, etc. and has had no real downtime since it started. The game has been played every day for 1294 days by a small number 
      of committed players.
