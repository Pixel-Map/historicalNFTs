  ## Our History

  **From Jan 22nd 2018 to Feb 2022, here is what we have accomplished and done so far. You can check out the classic game here: https://v1.cryptofighters.io**

  Back in December 2017 a group of friends got together on a mission to build a P2E blockchain based game on the Ethereum blockchain. The 
  inspiration for the game came from the famous CryptoKitties project that allowed players to breed new kitties from two other kitties. 
  This was enabled by storing genes associated with each kitty. 

  The concept was to be able to have a game that will allow the winner to earn a new NFT that is a combination of both teams genes. 
  
  This was achieved with the following gameplay:
  
  1. Players created a team of up to 5 fighters and enter the team into the CryptoFighters arena.
  2. Any other player can now choose to battle the team in the arena with his team. The winner was awarded a new fighter compiled from the genetic attributes of both teams. 
  3. The player awarded the new fighter can now choose to sell his NFT via the CryptoFighters marketplace or use the fighter in a battle.
  4. On Jan 22nd the first version of the game was deployed and was released to the public on Jan 23rd. 

  The fighters were generated every x amount of time and were released for auction in the CryptoFighters internal marketplace. Over time we 
  stopped the minting of new fighters. In total, combined with the newly minted fighters, 4954 fighters were minted and are in existence. 

  ## Pausing of Original Battle Contract
  On August 11th 2021, we decided to disable the battling contract resulting in no more battles being able to take place and we have no 
  plan to ever enable it again. 

  When we first launched the battle contract, gas fees were low and sustainable and cheap. The first battle cost $1.65 (priced at the time, 
  see here). We couldn't have imagined the gas fees would get so high. If enabled now, some battles would cost around $500 just to battle. 
  We didn't see this as sustainable and found in ruined gameplay.
