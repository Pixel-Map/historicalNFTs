  ## About
  Compose the best jingles on the blockchain, you can share them, sell them and love them.

  ## Samples
  Currently there are 100 sound samples available in the game with the possibility 
  to add more in the future. A sample can be one of 4 types of rarity: common, 
  rare, legendary and mythical. Rarer the sample, better the sound. There are 
  currently 59 common sounds, 30 rare, 10 legendary and only 1 mythical! Every 
  sound sample is hosted on IPFS and referenced on the main smart contract. 
  Samples have a fixed price of 0.001Ξ and can't be traded. In order to compose 
  a jingle you need 5 samples. When a sample is used to compose a jingle it 
  becomes a part of it and you can't use it in other jingles.

  ## Jingles
  Every jingle is unique in two aspects. One, nobody can create a jingle with 
  the same combination of sound samples. Two, we generate a unique cover image 
  that is based on the jingle identificator. As a result, a jingle can have value 
  because of its cover image and its sound. Jingles are tradable items that you 
  can put on sale in our marketplace for whatever price you think it’s worth. 
  Putting a jingle on sale is free, but we do take a 3% cut on a successful sale. 
  Additionally, a jingle has a name and a author. They are set when a jingle is 
  composed and can't be altered after that, even after a change of ownership. 
  The default name for every owner is Soundtoshi Nakajingles, you are free to 
  change this on your profile page.
