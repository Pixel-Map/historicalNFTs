faq:
  - question: What is the mint cost for CryptoSkulls?
    answer: CryptoSkulls were originally minted in 2019. No more can ever be minted.
  - question: What are the terms of use for a CryptoSkull that I own?
    answer: You can use your CryptoSkulls in any way that you want, including for commercial purpose. The owner of the NFT is the de-facto 
      holder of the copyright. 
  - question: How many CryptoSkulls does the original developer still have?
    answer: The original developer of CryptoSkulls has around 1,908 skulls left in his wallet. When he initially launched the project back 
      in 2019, he minted all 10,000 at once to his wallet and has been listing them incrementally since.  After the project was rediscovered 
      in January 2022, he committed to putting a pause on the listings and ultimately clearly stated how the remaining would be distributed.
  - question: Upcoming distribution of remaining skulls?
    answer: The following percentages reflect the equity portion of the entire CryptoSkulls network (all 10,000 NFTs).  15% of the supply 
      will be in community custody.  CryptoSkulls holders will be able to decide how to best use these via an upcoming governance process.  
      1.08% of the supply will be split between the cofounders. They can sell up to 2 of these a day.
      1% of the supply will be split between the cofounders. They have agreed not to sell these for 1 year.
      1% of the supply will be used to reward community builders.
      1% of the supply will be used in future giveaways
      80.1% of the supply is currently in circulation
