faq:
  - question: Who is Deep Black?
    answer: DeepBlack is the first Artificial Intelligence artist that has
      created the art and uploaded to the blockchain without any human interaction.
      DeepBlack endured extensive training on over 50,000 pieces of various types
      of artwork through the use of a supercomputer to enable the creation of a
      limited number of one of a kind, unique, and original art pieces.
  - question: About Deep Black?
    answer: DeepBlack is a project that causes us to question the concept of
      intelligence and the role of technology in today’s world. For many, the idea
      of artificial intelligence and a world dominated by technology instils fear.
      DeepBlack causes us to question this view; it shows us that AI can be powerful
      in a positive way, and that technology can be used to bring hope and
      achievement to society.
  - question: The Origins of DeepBlack?
    answer:
      DeepBlack was created in 2018 as an AI artist and was released on the
      blockchain the very first time more than 2 years ago. DeepBlack’s original
      project was not expected to succeed, it was for Pete (DeepBlacks Agent) to
      learn about the blockchain. The plan was to originally give access for people
      to be able to print out their DeepBlack and keep a copy of the art as a NFT.
  - question: The Generation Process?
    answer: DeepBlack uses a two step process to create its art. The Artificial
      Intelligence engine is a modified Generative Adversarial Network. The first
      step is the "Generator", the second is the "Discriminator". The process is
      fed with 50,000 images of existing artwork and the "Generator" attempts to
      create new artwork based on that input. The role of the "Discriminator" is
      to see if it can spot which pieces of art are computer generated. If it
      fails to spot a piece, that piece is considered successful.
  - question: Am I sure you will never mint new token?
    answer: Ownership of the smartcontract was transferred to the 0 address
      which is a famous burning address. This address is the only one able to
      withdraw funds and mint new token.
  - question: Are you the first NFT AI art?
    answer: "The answer is No, Talented human artists released AI art on Chain
      months before DeepBlack. DeepBlack is an innovative concept where the AI
      is the artist and not a tool used by an human. DeepBlack artworks were
      never reviewed by an human but curated by another AI. DeepBlack created
      various art movement, and painting styles: Abstract, Portrait, Landscape
      ... No human judged whether the artworks were good or not, it was what is
      was and it was DeepBlack’s creations. The creator of DeepBlack is a “tool
      guy” and has no art skill whatsoever, and the only Artist is the AI named DeepBlack.
      As far as we know DeepBlack is a  concept of AI artist, not AI art."
